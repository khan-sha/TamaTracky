# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

- `pwa-192x192.png` - 192x192 pixel icon for Android devices
- `pwa-512x512.png` - 512x512 pixel icon for Android devices and app stores

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using:
- Design tools (Figma, Adobe Illustrator, etc.)
- Online icon generators
- Image editing software

The icons should:
- Be square (equal width and height)
- Have a transparent or solid background
- Represent the Tama Tracky app visually
- Be high quality and recognizable at small sizes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use placeholder images or generate simple colored squares as temporary icons until final designs are ready.
