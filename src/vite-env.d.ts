/**
 * TypeScript declaration file for Vite.
 * 
 * This file provides type definitions for Vite-specific features,
 * such as importing static assets (images, CSS, etc.) in TypeScript files.
 * 
 * The triple-slash directive above tells TypeScript to include
 * the types from the vite/client module, which provides:
 * - Type definitions for import.meta.env
 * - Type definitions for importing static assets
 * - Type definitions for Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) API
