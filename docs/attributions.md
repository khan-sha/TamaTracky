# Attributions & External Resources

The development of Tama Tracky utilized a combination of original work and external learning resources in accordance with FBLA academic integrity expectations.

## Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assistance

AI tools were used as a development support resource, not as an autonomous coding system.

AI assistance was used for:

- Brainstorming feature ideas and system organization
- Reviewing code readability, formatting, and structure
- Assisting with documentation wording and explanations
- Helping explain programming concepts during development

**AI tools used:**

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** — used for guidance, explanations, and documentation support

All final implementation decisions, logic design, and testing were completed by the project team. No AI-generated code was used without review, understanding, and modification by the team.

## Online Learning Resources

The following resources were used for learning and reference:

- **Google Search** — documentation lookup, debugging references, syntax clarification
- **YouTube** — React, TypeScript, and frontend architecture tutorials
- **Official documentation** for frameworks and libraries listed below

Any referenced examples were adapted and rewritten to fit the needs of this project.

## Libraries & Frameworks

The following libraries and tools were used:

- **React** — frontend UI framework
- **TypeScript** — type-safe JavaScript development
- **Vite** — development server and build tool
- **HTML / CSS** — structure and styling
- **Browser localStorage API** — data persistence

All libraries are open-source and used under their respective licenses.

## Assets & Design

- Icons and UI elements were either custom-created or sourced from open-source libraries
- No copyrighted media requiring special permission was used

## Academic Integrity Statement

All submitted work represents the team's own understanding and implementation. External tools and learning resources were used responsibly to support learning, not to replace it. The final application reflects deliberate design, testing, and refinement performed by the team.
